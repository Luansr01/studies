# draw-loop
A simple terminal draw loop made with the ncurses library.
Draws a border with the height and width specified by the constants of the same name.
Has a Point class for keeping track of the points drawn.
Has a function to constrain a value to a specific range, and a function to check if any of the points inside a Point array is at the XY coordinates passed.

If any key is pressed, the program ends.

I will continue to update this.
