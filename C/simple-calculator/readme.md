# Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator made in C. <br>
It supports addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and (although pretty barebones) the calculation of equations. <br>
The user inputs do not have failsafes and the equation function only works in the order of inputs (not PEMDAS nor any other variant). <br>
Maybe I'll come back to it someday and fix those points, or maybe I'll just make a program with those features, who knows.
